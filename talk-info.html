              <p>In this talk, I will provide a comprehensive overview of Compute Express Link (CXL) technology, examining why it matters and where we currently stand in terms of its development. CXL is a high-speed, low-latency interconnect standard that allows for communication between CPUs and various types of accelerators, including FPGAs and GPUs. It enables devices to share memory space and cache coherence, allowing for faster data access and more efficient processing of complex workloads. We will explore the different versions of CXL, starting with the original CXL 1.0 specification and its subsequent updates, including the recently released CXL 3.0. I will discuss the key features of each version and how they differ from one another, as well as the benefits of using CXL over other interconnect standards.</p>

              <p>In addition to examining the technical aspects of CXL, I will also delve into the real-world implications of this technology. Specifically, I will discuss how CXL is being used in large-scale data centers and how it is helping to drive innovation in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Overall, this talk will provide a comprehensive understanding of CXL technology, from its foundational principles to its practical applications. Whether you're a hardware engineer, a software developer, or simply interested in the latest trends in computing, this talk will offer valuable insights into one of the most exciting new technologies on the market today.</p>

              <p id="invited_talk_1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Centralized Composable HPC Management with the OpenFabrics Managment Framework</span><br/><span style="font-style: italic;">Michael Aguilar</span> (Sandia National Labs)</p>

              <p>Traditional HPC systems are provisioned with static fixed quantities of memory, storage, accelerators, and CPU resources to execute requested computation. This is not sufficient for today’s datacenters that are running modern dynamic workloads, resulting in workloads executing on systems that are not optimized for their needs. Workloads may require hardware resources, e.g. GPUs, that are present in the datacenter but not on the server on which the workload is executing. Conversely, compute resources on a given server may be underutilized because they are not required by the workload running on that server. Thus, datacenters often end up overprovisioning hardware resources to attempt enabling any workload to run on any server.</p>

              <p>Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure (CDI) enables servers to be dynamically composed out of hardware resources physically disaggregated in the datacenter, and as needed by a given workload. Centralized resource management can potentially mitigate, out-of-memory conditions, IO thrashing, stranding of available resources, such as, CPUs, GPUs, and memories, and provide dynamic network fail-over. Resource Management, using a standardized interface, can enable clients to monitor, compose, and intelligently provision resources, in beneficial ways.</p>

              <p>The OpenFabrics Alliance in collaboration with the DMTF, SNIA, and the CXL Consortium, is developing an OpenFabrics Management Framework (OFMF) and a hardware Composability Manager. The OFMF is a open-source Resource Manager is designed for configuring fabric interconnects and managing composable disaggregated resources in dynamic HPC infrastructures using client-friendly abstractions. The goal of the OFMF is to enable interoperability through common interfaces to enable client Managers to efficiently connect workloads with resources in a complex heterogenous ecosystem, without having to worry about the underlying network technology.</p>

              <p id="invited_talk_2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Towards ML-driven resource orchestration in disaggregated memory systems: challenges and opportunities</span><br/><span style="font-style: italic;">Dimosthenis Masouros</span> (NTUA, Greece)</p>

              <p>The fixed resource capacity of modern Cloud servers poses several challenges regarding the efficient orchestration of computing resources. To alleviate this resource wall challenge, hardware (memory) disaggregation has been proposed as a new design paradigm, where the underlying infrastructure is organized as a pool of heterogeneous resources that can be composed on demand into compute units tailored to workload-specific requirements. However, even though hardware disaggregation offers more fine-grained organization of computing resources, it also introduces new optimization knobs, which have to be properly managed to truly exploit its benefits. ML-driven resource orchestration is a key player in this direction, however, questions like "where", "when" and "how" to use ML for resource orchestration of disaggregated systems are still vague. This talk highlights some of the key research questions and open problems in this area, gives examples of recent research that demonstrate the potential of ML-driven resource orchestration, and provides insights into the exciting new opportunities that ML presents for the future of disaggregated memory systems.</p>
